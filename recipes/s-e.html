            <h4>Recipe instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove steak from refrigerator and let come to room temperature, 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Rub steak with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and season all over with 1 ½ teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and ¾ teaspoon paprika.</li>
                <li>Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook, flipping once, until a deep golden crust begins to form on both sides of the steak, about 5 minutes total.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and add butter to pan. Using a kitchen towel, carefully grip the skillet handle and tilt towards you so that the melting butter forms a pool at the bottom of the skillet. Using a spoon, continually baste butter onto steak to form a deeper golden crust. Flip steak and repeat, 2 to 3 minutes in total. Using a meat thermometer, check for doneness: 120-125°F  for medium rare, 130°F for medium.</li>
                <li>Transfer steak onto a cutting board and let rest about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Crack egg into pan and cook 3 to 4 minutes, or until white is set and edges are just beginning to brown. Remove from pan and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Slice steak into 1" strips on a bias, against the grain.</li>
                <li>Serve steak with eggs and potatoes. Garnish with herbs and season with more salt, pepper, and paprika to taste.</li>
            </ol>
